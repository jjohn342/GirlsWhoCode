<p>
  I will be going into 11th grade this year, in Somerville High School. I live with my mom and dad. I was born in Guyana, South America and I came to NJ when I was 7 years old. I am now 15 years old.
  My birthday is September 4th, which makes me a Virgo.

  I like YA novels, mostly fantasy and contemporary.
  I also like to play video games. So far, I have played The Last Of Us, Rise Of The Tomb Raider, and Life Is Strange.
  Two years ago, I took sewing classes at RVCC.
  I like to travel and I also like photography.
  My dislikes include insects and antique dolls.
  My favorite apps to use are Youtube and Instagram.
